/*
The Builder design pattern is used to construct a complex object step by step.
The pattern allows the construction process to be separated from the objectâ€™s actual representation.
This is useful when an object can be created in many ways or involves multiple steps.

Key Aspects of the Builder Pattern:
- Builder Class: Defines how to construct different parts of the object.
- Product Class: Represents the complex object that is being built.
- Director Class (optional): Controls the construction process (though it can be omitted if the client controls the process).

Scenario:
We'll build a "House" that can have different components like windows, doors, and rooms.

Explanation:
- House (Product): Represents the object that is being built, i.e., the house.
  It has methods to set different components like windows, doors, and rooms.

- HouseBuilder (Abstract Builder): Declares the interface for creating parts of the House object.
  It ensures that each step (like building windows, doors, rooms) is defined,
  but it's up to concrete builders to implement those steps.

- ConcreteHouseBuilder (Concrete Builder): Implements the steps for creating specific parts of the House.
  In this case, it defines how to build the windows, doors, and rooms of the house.

- Director (optional): Controls the construction process. It can specify the order in which parts of the object are built.

- Client (Main Function): The client creates a ConcreteHouseBuilder and uses the Director to control the building process.
  After construction, the client retrieves the House and displays its properties.
