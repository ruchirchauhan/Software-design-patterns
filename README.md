# Most Used Software Design Patterns
I curated this list for my interview preparation, and soon realized, there was no single place where I can find both a good explanation and C++ example implementations, therefore this repository. Hope this helps more people !

All examples are under their respective category folders and every design pattern cpp file containes detailed explanation in form of comments.

*Note*: This list, by no means imply, that other design patterns are not important. Its just that you might find yourself using these more often than others

## Broad 3 categories:
### 1. Creational(C):
About different ways to create objects
### 2. Structural(S):
About Relationship between the objects
### 3. Behavioural(B):
About Interaction between the objects


## Ordered by:
*Note about how I ordered them*: I did google search on most important ones, searched youtube videos and then ranked them based on number of places they showed up. Not too scientific an approach, but not bad either. Those numbers in front of the pattern names show their occurrence rate. Higher the number, more frequently they showed up in my search results.

### 1. Categories
Creational- [singleton](Creational/singleton.cpp) 8 | [builder](Creational/builder.cpp) 8 | [factory](Creational/factory.cpp) 6 | [prototype](Creational/prototype.cpp)

Structural- [facade](Structural/facade.cpp) 6 | [adapter/bridge](Structural/adapter.cpp) 6 | [decorator](Structural/decorator.cpp) 4 | [proxy](Structural/proxy.cpp)

Behavioural- [observer](Behavioural/observer.cpp) 9 | [strategy](Behavioural/strategy.cpp) 7 | [state](Behavioural/state.cpp) 2 | [iterator](Behavioural/iterator.cpp) 2
