# Most Used Software Design Patterns
I started this for my interview preparation, and soon realized, there was no single place where I can find both a good explanation and C++ example implementations, therefore this repository. Hope this helps more people !

## Broad 3 categories:
### 1. Creational(C):
About different ways to create objects
### 2. Structural(S):
About Relationship between the objects
### 3. Behavioural(B):
About Interaction between the objects


## Ordered by:
Note about how I ordered them: I did google search on most important ones, searched youtube videos and then ranked them based on number of places they showed up. Not too scientific an approach, but not bad either. Those numbers in front of the pattern names show their occurrence rate.
